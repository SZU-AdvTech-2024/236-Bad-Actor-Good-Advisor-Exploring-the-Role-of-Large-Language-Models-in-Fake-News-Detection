The message contains a link to a photo of the 2012 Supermoon in Rio de Janeiro, which is described as ""unbelievable"" and ""like the ones in the movies."" 

There are several reasons why this message could be fake:

1. The language used in the message is overly enthusiastic and exaggerated. This is often a red flag for fake news, as it suggests that the author is trying to exaggerate the truth to make the message more compelling or attention-grabbing.

2. The message does not provide any context or information about the photo or the Supermoon event. This lack of context makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of the message, as it is possible that the photo was taken at a different time or place than the 2012 Supermoon event.

3. The message uses a URL to link to the photo, rather than embedding the photo directly in the message. This suggests that the author may be trying to avoid scrutiny or accountability by linking to an external source rather than posting the photo directly in the message.

4. The message includes a hashtag at the end, which is not necessary or relevant to the content of the message. This could be a sign that the author is trying to manipulate the search results or social media trends to make the message more visible or shareable.

Overall, the lack of context, exaggeration, and lack of accountability in the message suggest that it is more likely to be fake or misleading.",0,1," Plausibility: It is plausible that someone would post a photo of the 2012 Supermoon in Rio de Janeiro on Twitter.
